# Information-Seeking Prompts

Interviewer prompts that are not information-seeking, including minimal encouragers (see @nte-me) and clarification-/confirmation-seeking prompts (see @nte-clarification), will not be coded.

## Open Questions (Col 1) {#sec-oq}

::: panel-sidebar

A

:   Anchor: initial prompt to introduce the topic of concern for the interview

    -   "Tell me what (you have come/we are) here to talk about."

    -   Not always open-ended

INV

:   Open-ended initial invitation

BQ

:   Open-ended breadth question

DQ

:   Open-ended depth question
:::

Open-ended questions encourage an elaborate response but do not tell an interviewee what specific information is required. Interviewees have the freedom to choose what information will be reported and to narrate what happened in their own words (see @nte-oq).

1.  **Open-ended initial invitation:** These questions encourage interviewees to report everything about an event or occurrence of the event. They are typically the first prompt to start talking about the event (or an event occurrence).
    -   *Tell me everything that happened at Dan’s house, from the very beginning to the end.*

    -   *What happens when Jim hurts you?*
2.  **Open-ended breadth questions**: These encourage interviewees to report another act/activity/detail, without specifying what information is required.
    -   *Then what happened?*

    -   *What else happened the night Amy got sick?*
3.  **Open-ended depth questions**: These questions request further elaboration about a pre-disclosed event/experience/detail, without specifying precisely what information is required.
    -   They can target a current topic (e.g., “Tell me more about X,”)

        -   *What happened when you started to set the food out?*

        -   *Tell me everything you remember about swimming in the lake.*

    -   They can re-introduce a previously mentioned one (e.g., “Earlier you said X. Tell me more about X”).
4.  **Open-ended descriptive questions:** These invite elaborate detail about an object/person/location (rather than an action). These are useful for getting descriptive/contextual information, but not ideal for finding out what happened
    -   *Tell me about the car.*

    -   *Tell me more about the woman.*

## Topic Shifts (Col 1)

Code the first prompt in a series of consecutive prompts with the same topic.

C

:   Context: prompts requesting background/descriptive information that is not specific to an episode of abuse or about the generic abuse script (see @nte-context)

    -   **Suspect**: facts about the suspect (name, age, occupation, height, skin colour)

    -   **People**: facts about any other relevant people

    -   **Location**: facts about locations (e.g., layout of house, child's address at the time)

    -   **Time**: temporally relevant facts (e.g., what classroom/term the child was in at the time)

    -   **Contact**: how the child and suspect came to know each other, how often child and suspect meet

    ([BUT]{.underline} note that these details can be episodic if the interviewer is attempting to particularize a specific occurrence; e.g., “what year were you in the time it happened in the back garden?”). 

RFI

:   'Request for information': prompts requesting specific remembered details surrounding abusive acts

    -   **Suspect**: physical description (not usually relevant for known suspects like family members, teachers)

    -   **People**: any other relevant people present

    -   **Location**

    -   **Clothes**

    -   **Words**: gist of conversations

    -   **Object**

    -   **Timeframe**: prompts used to narrow down the timeframe of abuse (time of day/month/year)

    -   **Time**: other temporal details

    -   **Disclosure**: details about prior disclosures of the abuse

    -   **Action**: questions about actions (what someone did)

    -   **Gap**: other prompts requesting new details (see @nte-clarification). These include questions about reasons, causes, evaluations.

ACT

:   Details that are central to, and delineate the structure of, the abusive act.

    -   **Action**: seeking details explaining the overall actions that happened during the abuse (e.g., "What did he do?")
    -   **Body**: movement and positioning of victim/suspect body parts
    -   **Clothes**: placement and removal (establishing whether skin-to-skin contact occurred)
    -   **Subjective**: victim’s thoughts and emotions
    -   **Sensations**: victim’s physical sensations (pain)
    -   **Perspective**: what the victim could see or hear
    -   **Face**: suspect’s facial expression
    -   **Object**: movement and position of objects used by suspect
    -   **Injury**: injuries resulting from the abusive act
    -   **Words**: gist of conversations during abuse
    -   **Tone**: tone of suspect’s words
    -   **Duration**: duration of abusive act

## Event Shifts (Col 2)

E

:   This code is used to signal the start of the phase of the interview discussing a particular occurrence of abuse or the generic script of the abuse.

    -   Event number (**1,2,3...**): corresponds to the order in which the event is raised during the interview (not related to the labels used, e.g., first time)

    -   **Generic**: prompts from the interviewer seeking to elicit information about generalities/commonalities across occurrences (e.g., what usually happens)

    -   **Ambiguous**: use when it is unclear if the interviewer aims to elicit specific/episodic or generic details. This usually applies when the child has provided cues to suggest repeated abuse but the interviewer's prompts are in past tense. This can also apply when the child has only mentioned one occurrence so far but the interviewer's prompts are in timeless present tense.

    This code applies to the first information-seeking prompt about the particular occurrence/generic script that the child responds to with forensically relevant details about that particular occurrence/generic script.

## Repeated Abuse Prompts (Col 2)

### Prompt

Interviewer prompts to determine whether \>1 event occurred:

1.  Asking whether a previously mentioned abusive act occurred on one or more occasions.

2.  Establishing whether certain abusive acts occurred on the same or different occasions.

3.  Asking how many times the abuse occurred.

4.  Asking whether an occurrence of abuse ever occurred before the described occasion.

5.  Asking whether an occurrence of abuse ever occurred since the described occasion.

6.  Asking whether the described occasion was the only time it occurred.

7.  Clarifying the child’s previous response suggesting repeated abuse (only applies when 1.-6. do not apply).

### Time {#sec-time}

Interviewer prompts to focus on eliciting episodic detail about a particular occurrence:

1.  Using the term “first time.”

2.  Using the term “last time.”

3.  Using a label previously provided by the child.

4.  Using the terms “another time,” “other time,” “different time.”

5.  Using the term “remember best.”

6.  Using the term “one time,” “a time,” “any time.”

7.  Using the term “that time” in reference to the label raised by the child.

8.  Using the term “next time.”

9.  Using terms that suggest episodic details “did it ever happen on a birthday”

This code does not apply to subsequent prompts in a series of consecutive prompts about a particular time. In other words, this code only applies when the interviewer is trying to shift the interview into a discussion of a particular occurrence.

### Difference

Interviewer prompts about differences among/between events:

1.  Any differences across events?

2.  Specific detail same or different across events?

3.  During which event did a specific detail occur?

### Similarity

Interviewer prompts about similarities among/between events:

1.  Were the events similar?

2.  Same location?

### Temporal

Interviewer prompts requesting information about when each event occurred, frequency of abuse, and the temporal relationships among events (e.g., order, gap between events). This code is only relevant for when repeated abuse has been established in the interview. For example, asking how many times the abuse occurred would be coded as `temporal` and not `prompt>3` if the child has already disclosed multiple occurrences of abuse in the interview.

+---------------+-----------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+

## D {#sec-d}

Initial disclosure: the earliest point at which the child disclosed an abusive event, irrespective of whether they elaborated upon what happened ("to talk about the rude stuff", "he touched me down there")

-   **re1**: Disclosure of abuse including episodic labels/details that are differentiated as different occurrences of abuse.

-   **re2:** Disclosure that abuse has occurred a certain number of times or “more than once” without specific episodic labels/details.

-   **cue:** Disclosure of abuse including linguistic cues (see below) suggesting that there is more than one event.

-   **single:** Disclosure of a single episode of abuse

-   **ambiguous:** Disclosure of abusive experience that could be a single episode or repeated

## Cue {#sec-cue}

Linguistic cues from the child’s response suggesting they are recalling general script information. *This code is used prior to the interviewer establishing repeated abuse (i.e., prior to any event\>generic/event\>number shifts).*

-   **tense:** Actions described in the timeless present tense.

-   **optional:** Use of optional qualifiers (e.g., *sometimes, or, if*).

-   **conditional**: use of conditional qualifiers (e.g., whenever)

-   **you**: use of impersonal "you" pronoun

## Story {#sec-story}

Narrative details provided in response to **open questions** (see @sec-oq). What counts as a detail?

-   **1:** What happened in the lead-up to the abuse? (Establishes suspect’s intent/knowledge to commit the act(s)).

-   **2:** What happened during the abusive act(s)? (Illegal acts of high investigative relevance).

-   **3:** What happened after the abuse until no other offending occurred? (Includes what made it stop and what happened after).

## OT {#sec-ot}

Off-track responses are responses that do not provide the information requested by the interviewer's prompt or do not address the issue raised by the interviewer. These are usually unproductive responses that do not confirm, deny, or provide new forensically relevant information (except for *multiple* & *cue*).

-   **Silence**: The child does not provide a verbal or gestural response to the question.

-   **Filler**: The child's response is comprised of only filler words (e.g., umm, ahh).

-   **Refusal**: The child explicitly declines to answer the interviewer’s question, such as by stating, 'I don’t want to talk about that' or 'I won’t answer that.'"

-   **IDK**: Responses that express lack of memory, knowledge, or understanding, such as 'I don’t know,' 'I don’t remember,' 'I’m not sure,' or 'I don’t get what you mean.' This also includes 'no' responses to yes/no questions that probe for memory or knowledge (e.g., 'Do you remember what he was wearing?')."

-   **Sidetrack**: A response that is overtly off-topic and non-substantive, such as shifting to an unrelated topic, discussing irrelevant events, or providing irrelevant personal anecdotes.

-   **Question**: An uninvited question posed by the child in response to the interviewer’s prompt. This includes questions that divert attention from the topic at hand, such as 'Why do you need to know that?' or 'Can I go now?' Clarification-seeking questions, rhetorical questions, or questions recounted in dialogue (e.g., 'Then he said, "What are you doing here?"') are excluded because they engage with the topic or provide relevant context.

-   **Repeat**: A response that repeats information already discussed in the interview without elaborating or adding new details.

-   **Multiple**: A response that contains details from other episodes of abuse besides the particular episode that the interviewer is asking about.

-   **Cue**: A response that contains linguistic cues that the child is recalling generic script information when the interviewer is asking about a particular episode of abuse.

-   **No**: The child says no when the interviewer suggests potential episodes of abuse (e.g., time\>9, see [-@sec-time])

### React {#sec-react}

[**SPECIAL (not child response) Interviewer reactions to off-track responses will be coded dichotomously as follows:**]{.underline}

**Accept**: The interviewer acknowledges the off-track response and adapts their approach. They can achieve this by:

-   Changing the focus in their subsequent prompt (e.g., shifting topics)

-   Adjusting the format of the question to make it easier for the child to answer (e.g., Interviewer: “*Has it happened many times?*” Child: “I don't know.” Interviewer: “*Has it happened one time or more than one time?*”).

-   Validating the child’s difficulty (either explicitly or implicitly) without dismissing the off-track response.

-   **L**: Use this when the interviewer's prompt is leading (introduces details the child hasn't provided, see @nte-lq)

**Reject**: The interviewer disregards the off-track response and requests the same information in their subsequent prompt in a way that:

-   Increases pressure on the child to respond (e.g., Interviewer: “Has it happened many times?” Child: “I don't know.” Interviewer: “How many times has it happened?”)

-   Signals dissatisfaction with the child’s off-track response.

-   Does not acknowledge or accommodate the child’s difficulty.

# Other Codes (Col 3)

**Break**

-   Suspension in transcript (break in the recording)

**Indistinct**

Response/prompt is inaudible/indistinct (as noted in the transcription) and cannot be inferred based on context

-   Includes issues like fault in recording or inaudible segments.

**Interruption**

-   A situation that causes a deviation from the substantive phase of the interview while the recording continues.

-   Includes situations where the interviewer proposes a break, then continues with the interview anyway.

# Coding Rules

1.  Codes are not mutually exclusive, \>1 code can be applied at each turn (use commas to separate them when applicable).

2.  If multiple sub-categories of the same code apply to a single turn, you can use this syntax code\>sub-category1\>sub-category2\>... (e.g., cue\>conditional\>optional, story\>1\>2). The order of the sub-categories should match the order in the response/prompt.

3.  Child responses to interviewer facilitators (non-suggestive words, such as 'ok' or 'yes') and minimal encouragers (see @nte-me) that encourage them to continue an ongoing response to the previous prompt are attributed to the preceding information-seeking prompt.

4.  Code the final prompt from the interviewer if more than one question is asked in a turn.

5.  If it takes the interviewer multiple turns to finish asking their question, code the final turn. This can happen when the interviewer is contextualising their prompt by summarising or clarifying previously discussed information.

6.  Coding ends when the interviewer either asks “are there any other times X…” (or similar) and the child says no and no further occurrences arise, or when the interviewer begins procedural duties at the end of the interview (e.g., was everything you told me today the truth?). If the interviewer returns to questioning about the abuse, continue coding.

# Notes

::: {#nte-context .callout-note title="Context"}
Context prompts are usually used for requesting semantic information ("known information rather than remembered). Note that it may depend on context; if a child has only been to a house where the abuse took place *one time,* then a question about where the kitchen was in relation to the bedroom is *episodic.* This also applies when talking about a house the child used to live in. But, if the interviewer and child are talking about the child’s current home, this is not a memory, and so it is context.

**A quick rule** (keeping in mind that quick rules are not always perfect): Ask yourself two questions: 1) Is the prompt about act(s) of abuse \[including particularizing detail about when and where\]?  If NO (but still relevant to the abuse), it’s probably contextual.
:::

::: {#nte-clarification .callout-note title="Clarification-/Confirmation-Seeking Prompts"}
Clarification- and confirmation-seeking prompts do **not seek new information** but instead clarify or confirm details already shared by the child.

-   When you say your brother, which brother is that?

-   You heard him say that?

In contrast, information-seeking prompts aim to gather new details that expand the narrative.

-   You said that dad drinks. Had dad been drinking that night?

-   How did you know he drank that night?
:::

::: {#nte-me .callout-note title="Minimal Encouragers"}
Minimal encouragers signal to a speaker that they are being listened to and understood without breaking the interviewee’s train of thought. Minimal encouragers can be verbal (e.g., saying ‘uh huh’, ‘Mhmm’, repeating a few words the interviewee said) or non- verbal (e.g., head nodding).

-   ***Interviewee**: He gave me his number. **Interviewer**: Uh-huh.*

<!-- -->

-   ***Interviewee**: We went in the shed. **Interviewer**: In the shed? **Interviewee**: Yeah, and I sat on the couch and then he got the pictures.*
:::

::: {#nte-oq .callout-note title="Helpful Tips"}
1.  **Requesting precision doesn’t make a question specific.** Asking someone to be precise (e.g., “Tell me exactly what happened”) doesn’t make a question specific. Consideration must be given to whether the question dictates what information is being requested.

<!-- -->

2.  **Requesting someone to be elaborate doesn’t make a question open-ended.** Asking someone to be elaborate (e.g., “Tell me everything you can remember about the colour of his tie”) doesn’t make a question open. Consideration must be given to whether the question dictates what information is being requested.

<!-- -->

3.  **The words ‘Tell’, ‘Explain’, and ‘Describe’ do not make questions open-ended.** When deciding if a question is open-ended or specific, don’t focus on key words, but rather, whether the question is telling the interviewee what precise details the interviewer is looking for. (E.g., “Tell me what you won your gold medal for?”)

<!-- -->

4.  **Focus on the structure of the question, not the response it elicits.** Sometimes interviewers try to soften an open-ended question with the phrases, ‘Can you ...’, ‘Are you able to tell me ...’, and ‘Do you know/remember ...’ to make it sound more polite. Although they may intend to invite an elaborate response (and many interviewees will interpret them that way), they allow for a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ response.
:::

::: {#nte-lq .callout-note title="Leading Questions"}
Leading questions presume or raise an aspect or detail that hasn’t already been mentioned by the child or established to be true.

-   May or may not pressure the child to agree ("... right?")

-   Often suggest that a particular response is expected (e.g., “Joe hit you, didn’t he?”)

Others presume one or more details and ask the interviewee to talk about them without checking first whether they happened (e.g., “Tell me about Susan’s dog” when it hasn’t been established that Susan had a dog). A simple yes/no or forced-choice questions is leading if it raises a highly specific detail, an issue of contention or narrows response options, irrespective of whether the interviewee is given the option to reject suggested details.

**Quick rule**: If the quesiton contains words, terminology, events or details that haven’t been mentioned by the child, the question can be classified as leading.
